# Why I deserve an A
I looked into implementing perlin noise for the water surface
(it somehow looks not quite right and I am still working on it)
I implemented shape, normals, lighting, texture, transparency etc.

# What left to be done
1. I am exploring a water shader that gives the water reflection and water ripples when the ball falls into water
2. I will add more elements to the Rob Goldenberg Machine that includes a skeleton animation
3. I will give the ability to change the view point from outside of the machine to the ball itself

(some minor improvements that need to be done)
1. I will finish the ball movement. I ended up not being able to implement the collision detection so I will manually calculate the position
2. I am aware that the water normal is not right
